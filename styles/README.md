# Styles

This folder documents styling guidance for the Specula Terminal experience. Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and
`app/globals.css` provides the ambient background, grid texture, and typography choices. Add any future design tokens or
component-level styles here to keep the `app/` and `components/` directories focused on UI structure and behavior.
